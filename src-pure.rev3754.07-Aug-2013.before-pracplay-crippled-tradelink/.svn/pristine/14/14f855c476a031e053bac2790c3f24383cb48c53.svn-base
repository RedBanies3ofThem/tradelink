#summary Dealing with 'Broker Server not found'

Many of the tradelink programs require a broker connector.   

If you don't have one running, you'll get this error with programs that require it.

Here are things to try :
 # Ensure your broker is running.   Start->programs->tradelink connectors-> your broker.
 #  [VcRedist Make sure vc Redistributables are installed]
 # If you're still receiving an error, restart all programs in question (broker software, connector, any tradelink programs)
 # If you are using Anvil and receiving message, see below :
