#summary initial positions at response startup

Responses are notified of any existing positions at response startup via GotPosition.

In general these positions are passed to Position trackers, so beyond that you don't need to worry about them.

However you can implement custom logic if you want regarding these positions

{{{
public class myresponse : ResponseTemplate
{
  PositionTracker pt = new PositionTracker();
  override void GotPosition(Position p)
  {
     D("initial pos: "+p.ToString());
     // get and display 52week avg price for this position
     D(p.Symbol+" avg: "+Calc.Avg(BarListImpl.DayFromGoogle(p.Symbol).Close()));
     pt.Adjust(p);
     
  }
  override void GotFill(Trade t) { pt.Adjust(t); }
}
}}}
