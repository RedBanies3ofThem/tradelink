_Invalid aws key/id_  Re-enter your key.  Copying/pasting extra spaces or characters will cause this message.

_Registered code shows as unregistered_  Ensure that you can access your secure URL in a webbrowser.   If you get access denied in a webbrowser, your URL isn't public.  In this case even if your code is registered in warden your apps/strategies can't authenticate.  go back to 'setup' instructions above and make your URL public.
