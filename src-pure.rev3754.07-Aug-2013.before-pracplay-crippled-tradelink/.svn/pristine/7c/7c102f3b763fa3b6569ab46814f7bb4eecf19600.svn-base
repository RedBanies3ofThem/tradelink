#summary Quick introduction of working with ticks in tradelink

= Introduction =

Ticks are easy to work with.  

  # Connect to a server.   
  # Register your gotTick event.
  # Build a basket of securities you want ticks for.
  # Subscribe to the basket.
  # handle the gotTick event

When new quotes or trades occur, these are passed as Tick instances to your gotTick function.
