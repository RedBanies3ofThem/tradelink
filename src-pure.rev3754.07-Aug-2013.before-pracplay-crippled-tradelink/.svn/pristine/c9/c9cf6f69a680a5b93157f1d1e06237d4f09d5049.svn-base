#summary Formalize idea as an algorithm

Example idea : Buy 52week Highs and Sell 52-week lows.

FEATURES
 * program will be run inside TradeLink ASP
 * GUI on startup that provides grid with symbol list
 * columns in grid are : symbol, entrysize, entry price
 * via right click, user provides an initial list of SYMBOLS
 * via right click, user can provide a URL from which any matching symbols will be removed from initial list (FILTERED = SYMBOLS - IGNORE)
 * Obtain yearly charts for all symbols remaining in FILTERED list
 * Get 52HIGH and 52LOW for each symbol
 * program eliminates any FILTERED symbols that are not breaking out, eg have not made NEWHLCOUNT highs or lows in last NEWHLLOOKBACK days.   ACCEPTED = FILTERED - NONBREAKOUT
 * ACCEPTED symbols will be displayed in GUI to user
 * user provides NEWHLCOUNT and NEWHLLOOKBACK values via right click option
 * any remaining symbols will be subscribed to obtain intra-day ticks
 * upon first print in symbol as OPEN, calculate GAP = OPEN - YestCLOSE
 * if symbol GAP< GAPFILTER, program will place entries (buy stops at 52week high and sell stops at 52-week low)
 * entries order size will be ENTRYSIZE = SYMCAPITAL/CLOSING PRICE
 * GAPFILTER and SYMCAPITAL will be provided by user via right-click GUI
 * upon sending entry order, program will update size and price in grid
 * upon a fill, profit targets and stop losses will be placed at PROFITDIST and STOPDIST respectively
 * user will provide PROFITDIST and STOPDIST via right-click GUI option
 * program will flat any positions still existing by SHUTDOWNTIME
