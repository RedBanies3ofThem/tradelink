#summary Spread-trading with TradeLink

PairsTracker can be used for simple pairs-trading setups in TradeLink.

It's also an example for building re-useable trading components.   

For example, you could take PairsTracker and modify it to spread trade more than 2 symbols (3,5, an entire basket of stocks, etc).
