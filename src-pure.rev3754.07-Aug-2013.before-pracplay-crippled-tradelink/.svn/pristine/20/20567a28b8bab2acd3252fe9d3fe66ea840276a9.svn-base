public partial class MyFormApp : AppTracker
{
 public const string PROGRAM = "MyFormApp";
 public MyFormApp()
 {
      // report stats here if tracking enabled
      // this url should handle post requests (eg just log them to a file)
      TrackURL = "http://mysite.com/apptracking";
      // see whether user has consented to application tracking (eg on install)
      TrackEnabled = Util.TrackUsage(PROGRAM);
      // report stats for this program
      Program = PROGRAM;
