#summary Adding brokers in tradelink

A tradelink broker can support any number of features.

To use a broker across all the applications (or trade a response with it), the following features need to be added :


|| Feature / market event || TLServer_WM c# method/event || TLServer c++ method || TL Message ||
|| requesting ticks for symbols || Register || Register || SUBSCRIBE ||
|| ticks|| newTick || SrvGotTickAsync || TICKNOTIFY|| 
|| sending orders || newServerFillRequest || SendOrder || SENDORDER ||
|| order notification|| newOrder|| SrvGotOrder ||ORDERNOTIFY ||
|| fill notification || newFill || SrvGotFill || EXECUTENOTIFY ||
|| initial position notification || newPositionRequest || PositionRequest || POSITIONREQUEST/POSITIONRESPONSE ||
|| cancels || CancelOrder || CancelOrder || CANCELREQUEST ||
|| order notification || newCancel || SrvGotCancel || CANCELRESPONSE ||
|| feature notification || newFeatureRequest || FeatureRequest || FEATUREREQUEST/FEATURERESPONSE ||
|| custom broker features || newUnknownFeature || UnknownFeature || any ||



Here is the general process, what responses expect to happen : 
{{{
trades 
sendorder -> GotOrder (when/if acknowledged) -> (when fill occurs) GotFill 
ticks 
sendbasket -> GotTick (when/if ticks occur in basket) 
cancels 
sendcancel -> GotOrderCancel (when/if order is canceled) 
here is how it works at the protocol level, you don't need to worry 
about this for what you're doing but if you're curious these are the 
messages that correspond to the above calls : 
trades 
SENDORDER -> ORDERNOTIFY -> (when fill occurs) EXECUTENOTIFY 
ticks 
REGISTERSTOCKS -> TICKNOTIFY (when ticks occur in registered symbols) 
cancels 
CANCELREQUEST -> CANCELRESPONSE (when cancel occurs) 
}}}




To find a connector to use as a template, and more information :
 * [http://code.google.com/p/tradelink/source/checkout Checkout SterServer project for an example of a .net broker]
 * [http://code.google.com/p/tradelink/source/checkout Checkout the BrokerServers\TWSServer for an example of a c++ broker]
 * [http://groups.google.com/group/tradelink-users/browse_thread/thread/8579f31d8fb72d7c# You may wish to consult this thread.]

When you are done :
 * [TradeLink make sure you can run the quick starts]
 * [TradeLinkBuild#Creating_Patches make sure you submit the connector as a patch so it works automatically with future releases]
