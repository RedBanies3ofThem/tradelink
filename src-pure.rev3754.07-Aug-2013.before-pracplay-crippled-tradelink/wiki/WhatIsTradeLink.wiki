=== Benefits Delivery ===

Tradelink lets users build strategies in minutes or hours.  

This is the fastest way to monetize your tradelink use.

Most users start this way, using tradelink off-the-shelf applications :
  * Gauntlet
  * ASP
  * Quotopia
  * Connectors
  * etc

Tradelink's Off-the-shelf platform minimizes decision making for new users.  We call off-the-shelf users Platform users.

Platform users benefit from :
  * high performance 
  * zero upfront cost (open source model)
  * 25,000+ installed base and 500+ member developer community
  * flexibility to change underlying platform at any future point (open source)

Apart from the platform, many Tradelink users have very specific trading or business requirements.  Frequently this is because they :
  * outgrow existing 3rd party platforms 
  * are tradelink platform users who outgrow one of the platform apps

Users that fit these descriptions may benefit from Tradelink AppKit.  

AppKit Benefits :
  * generally less expensive than switching platforms
  * faster than switching platforms
  * better control versus choosing from existing platforms
  * overall, AppKit improves your ROI

We call users who build their own tradelink applications AppKit users or SDK users (software development kit).

Both the platform applications and the AppKit are open sourced on tradelink.org via the LGPL license.

=== Platform In Depth ===

The off-the-shelf applications in TradeLink are comparable to closed source platforms like
  * TradeStation
  * NinjaTrader
  * NeoTicker
  * etc

Tradelink benefits beyond these platforms :
  * performance
  * openness  
  * low-latency high frequency trading 
  * standard intraday/daily/weekly strategies and indicators

These benefits allows you to immediately trade a wider range of strategies, in a more efficient way.

Tradelink's open source nature helps you minimize risks :
 * zero cost option to meet current needs 
 * zero cost option to adapt to unknown future requirements
 * avoid proprietary vendor architectures which may meet your needs today but not tomorrow
 * avoid pricing lock-ins from vendors who stop innovating

[TradeLinkSuite Tradelink's platform applications], let you:
 * construct, test and trade algorithmic strategies (gauntlet, ASP)
 * construct and trade discretionary/semi-automated strategies (ASP, quotopia)
 * Collect market data and analyze it for trends (record, gauntlet, ASP)
 * Do all of the above across many [ProviderFeatureMatrix brokers and feeds], in live or simulated environments.
