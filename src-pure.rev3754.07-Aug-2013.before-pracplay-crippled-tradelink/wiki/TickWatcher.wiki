#summary alert you if your feed drops

If you're 100% automated, you need to know if your feed drops.

TickWatcher will do this for you automatically.  

If you choose, He will also alert you when your first tick arrives... this way you can be sure your system started trading each day.


eg:

{{{

public class MyBox : ResponseTemplate
{
TickWatcher tw = new TickWatcher();
public MyBox()
{
  // default is to alert if no ticks for 60seconds
  tw.DefaultWait = 60;
  // default is to fire the FirstTick event on first tick for each symbol
  tw.FirstTick = true;
  tw.Alert+=new SymDelegate(alert);
  tw.FirstTick+= new SymDelegate(first);
}

void GotTick(Tick k)
{
  // watch the feed for whatever symbols you're tracking
  tw.Watch(k);
}
void alert(Security s)
{
  Email.Send("mycellphone@mydomain.com","no ticks on "+s.Symbol,"");
}

void first(Security s)
{
  Email.Send("mycellphone@mydomain.com","first tick for "+s.Symbol,"");
}
   
}

}}}

TickWatcher enforces your alert settings in two ways.  

 # by checking when ticks arrive.  
 # by checking on regular intervals.  (by default around every second or so, give or take)

You can change the default interval in between checks, this paramter is set as # of milliseconds between checks in the constructor.   To change it to 5 seconds :

{{{
// timeout checks are performed worse-case every 5seconds or so
TickWatcher _tw = new TickWatcher(5000);
}}}

Rest of the code from previous example would remain the same.
