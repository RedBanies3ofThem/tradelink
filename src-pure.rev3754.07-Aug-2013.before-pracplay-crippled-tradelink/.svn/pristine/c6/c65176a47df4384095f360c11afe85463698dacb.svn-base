#summary how to find log files in tradelink

=== TradeLink Logs ===

 # Start->Programs->TradeLink->Logs
 # locate the folder that corresponds to the program in question
 # eg, ASP for ASP, ServerSterling for SterServer, etc
 # inside this folder you will see a text log file for every day the program has run

=== Sterling-Side logs ===
 
sterling does not save it's own log files by default.   You must start them at startup of sterling pro.

  # start sterling pro
  # Windows -> Activity log and Notification Log. 
  # By doing that, two extra windows open up.  
  # you can copy/paste this data to a text file in notepad (start->programs->accessories->notepad)
