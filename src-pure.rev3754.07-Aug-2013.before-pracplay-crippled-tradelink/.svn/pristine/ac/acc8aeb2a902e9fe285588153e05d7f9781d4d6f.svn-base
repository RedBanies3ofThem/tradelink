#summary Setting up Interactive Brokers TWS for use with TradeLink

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

=== Pre-requisites === 
 # [http://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/control/systemstandalone.php?os=win&ib_entity=llc Install IB TWS] and TradeLink
 # An IB account.  We recommend testing with a paper trading account.
 # if you don't have an account, use demo account: user: edemo password: demouser

=== Setup === 
 # In TWS, choose Configure->API and enable socket connections
 # Make TWS run on a port in the 7496-7500 range (default place the _InteractiveBrokers_ connector (`TWSServer.exe`) looks)
 # You should add the IP address 127.0.0.1 to the _Trusted IP Addresses_ field  (see screenshot)

=== Testing === 
Once you have TWS running and pre-requisites configured:
 # start _InteractiveBrokers_ from the Start menu -> ... -> _TradeLink Connectors_
 # open Quotopia and start typing a symbol and verify you can get quotes (e.g. just type 'AAPL')
 # double click a symbol to send orders and verify this is working.
 # start ASP to trade a response, etc.

=== IB Security Symbols ===

IB has very particular (and also sometimes inconsistent) ways of providing a particular contract.

{{{<symbol/localsymbol/classname> <exchange> <security type>}}}

Examples:
 * EUR.USD CASH IDEALPRO  (spot FOREX currency)
 * 6BU1 GLOBEX FUT  (GBP.USD September 2011 currency futures)
 * AAPL   ('STK' is implied by default)
 * FSFX_OCT_11 FUT DTB
 * IBM CALL 201111 165

The easiest way to determine the correct symbol :
 # right click the symbol in TWS
 # choose _Contract Info_ -> _Description_, 
 # "Symbol/LocalName/LocalClass", "Security Type" and "Exchange". 
 # If you need to determine letter codes for futures contract months, look [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract#Codes here].

With Verbose enabled you can also send an order from TWS and you'll see the correct symbol to use in tradelink in the tws connector window/log.

=== Quotopia Symbol Note ===

When using quotopia with long symbols (those that contain a space), you should end your symbol with a comma.   Even if you are only specifying one symbol.   for example

ESH3 GLOBEX FUT,
J7H3 GLOBEX FUT,

or for multiples at the same time :

YG___APR_13 NYSELIFFE FUT,GCJ3 NYMEX FUT,IBM

ASP always requires commas to be used for multiple symbols, never for single symbol.

=== Common Questions === 
 * You can enable verbose logging by setting line below VERBOSE to 1 in TwsConfig.txt in folder you installed TradeLink
 * If you need to change your account currency, see `TwsServer.Config.txt` in folder you installed TradeLink
