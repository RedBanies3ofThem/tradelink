#summary Guidelines to follow if you have been granted commit rights

In general :
 * It's better to send a 'diff' of your changes to the users list prior to committing, to get feedback
 * Don't commit code that is known to be broken (eg test it first)
 * Have unit tests for your code whenever possible, and commit those too

Specifically : 
 * When you are ready to commit, open an [http://code.google.com/p/tradelink/issues/list issue] that reflects the reason for your change
 * In your commit, reference the issue # (so the history can be obtained)
 * Mark the issue as 'verified' if you have confirmed that it works 
 * mark the issue as 'fixed' if you have not confirmed it works
 * When closing an issue with fixed or verified, cite the commit revision #s associated with your commit, (eg if it was release 1433, cite it as r1433 so it can be clicked on through the UI)
