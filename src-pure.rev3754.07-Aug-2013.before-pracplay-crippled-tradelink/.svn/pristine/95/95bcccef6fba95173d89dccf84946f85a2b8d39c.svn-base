#summary How to modify one of the example responses (or another response you have)

Pretty simple. Steps:

 # [CsharpIde download an ide] (we recommend visual 2008 express)
 # start your ide, file->open and browse to the project (response.csproj) or solution file (solution.sln) included in your project
 # you will see the source code and all the files included in your project
 # find the file containing the name of the response you wish to modify (generally file has same name as the response)
 # make whatever changes are necessary
 # file-> save to save changes
 # click the 'build' button (or choose build from the build menu) to build the project.
 # this will create a new DLL file with your changes (usually inside of your project folder bin\Release\response.dll)
 # you can then import the dll into any of the tradelink programs as before

Example 'change default bar interval on SMA response'
 # open IDE
 # start->programs->tradelink->Response examples
 # find SMAResponse.cs
 # open it
 # find the place where the default bar internal is set and change it, eg:
{{{
// starts like this
        BarInterval _barinterval = BarInterval.FiveMin;
// change to whatever you desire
        BarInterval _barinterval = BarInterval.Hour;
}}}

Then click save and build, and move the responses.dll wherever you want to use it.  

the next time you open SMAResponse from this dll, it will have the new default value.
