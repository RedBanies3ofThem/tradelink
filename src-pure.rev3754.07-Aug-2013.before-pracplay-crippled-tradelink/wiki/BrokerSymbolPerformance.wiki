#summary Realtime performance with many symbols

TradeLink has two realtime feed protocols supported :
 * IP gets 20-40,000 ticks/second
 * Legacy gets 15-30,000 ticks/second ([RemoteProviderConnection legacy is presently the default protocol])

The number of symbols you can handle with this depends on the symbols and the tick frequency on any given day.

On average you should be able to get in this range of symbols for equities :
 * IP 200-2,000 
 * Legacy 100-1,000

*The caveat is that not every broker can support these levels of throughput*

Here are user reports for selected brokers :
