#summary Tick buffer overruns

These messages can appear when :
 * you have many symbols subscribed
 * you are trading very frequently ticking/trading symbols
 * the market 'pushes' in above average trading activity
 * Your machine is doing many things and it gets behind processing ticks

In all of these cases, buffer overruns will occur.

Buffer overruns can result in lost/bad ticks.

If you see these messages, just increase the size of your buffer.    Every 10,000 size increase in your buffer will use an extra half megabyte of memory.   

To do this :
 # locate folder you installed tradelink (eg c:\program files\tradelink)
 # find asp.exe.config
 # increase the size of the tickbuffersize value until you no longer receive overruns
 # restart ASP if it was already running
