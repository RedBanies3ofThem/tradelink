#summary TradeLink and FIX

_Does TradeLink work with FIX?_

Yes.  [http://code.google.com/p/tradelink/wiki/ProviderFeatureMatrix  TradeLink supports FIX]

FIX is not a plug and play standard, implementations vary depending on the 
broker.

You will need to take [http://code.google.com/p/tradelink/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FServerFix  the FIX template connector in tradelink] and adapt it to your specific Broker's implementation.
