_"I've just started using this and think it's a brilliant piece of kit. I've been searching for something like this for some time. A c# open source framework that I could use as a base for some of my own stuff. Really pleased"_

_"I use tradelink because I want to use c#  rather than  other platform
dependant language like MQL  to implement
automatic trading strategies, and among those similar open source
projects available on internet, I  think tradelink has
the most powerful and complete libraries eg Tradelink.Commmon,
Tradelink.API and TradeLink.Appkit."

_"Tradelink provides a firm foundation to build upon. You don't have to reinvent the wheel and so much is provided out of the box and that functionality is always growing. Indicators, order management, logging, back testing, the list goes on. A great library that helps get you to trading faster."_
