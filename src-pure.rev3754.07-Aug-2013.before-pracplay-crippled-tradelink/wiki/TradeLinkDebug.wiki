#summary Tips for solving problems and collecting problem information

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />


=== Introduction ===

Most problems can be solved without using the debugger.  

See the [TroubleShooting troubleshooting section first.]  Then try the debugger.

Since tradelink is open source, it's easy to debug problems.


=== TradeLink Application Debugging ===

 # [http://code.google.com/p/tradelink/wiki/TradeLinkBuild#Fetch_Source_Code Obtain source code]
 # [CSharpIde install an ide if you haven't already]
 # Open the TradeLinkSuite.sln file in c# express File->Open Solution
 # On project->Configuration Manager menu, change the solution from Release to Debug build
 # Build the project in debug mode
 # Close the solution
 # Open your application project/solution  (eg MyApp.sln).   
 # Switch to debug mode in same way as above and build project.
 # Set a breakpoint in your application code
 # Breakpoints determine where program will stop executing so you can examine output
 # You can set or unset a breakpoint by clicking on line number next to a line of code
 # when setting a breakpoint, a red dot will appear.  If you do it again, it should disappear
 # Once you have set breakpoint, right click on Application and choose right click -> debug
 # your application will start
 # When your breakpoint is hit, execution will stop and you can inspect variables inside your program
 # To continue executing, hit F5.   You can also remove or set new breakpoints while debugging


=== Tips ===

 * You can set breakpoints in your code or in tradelink code (or both), depending on what you wish to inspect
 * You can add a variable to watch list by right clicking it and choosing add watch.   
 * If you wish to debug common libraries, you should also add TradeLinkAPI TradeLinkCommon and potentially TradeLinkAppKit or TradeLinkResearch depending on what you're testing
