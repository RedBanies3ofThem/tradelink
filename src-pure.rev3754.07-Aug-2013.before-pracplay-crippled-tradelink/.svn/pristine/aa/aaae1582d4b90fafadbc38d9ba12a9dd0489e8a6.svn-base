=== Developing or Extending TDServer ===

You can use TD Ameritrade as is with TradeLink without doing anything else.

If you download the TradeLink source code and try to compile the Ameritrade connector, you will receive an error that "AmeritradeBrokerAPI.cs" is missing. This is because if you want to modify the source code, we ask that you sign the TD Ameritrade NDA.

To do this:
 # Email apidev@tdameritrade.com 
 # Tell them you develop with TradeLink and want to sign their NDA.   
 # Once you've signed it, you will be able to obtain the [http://apiforums.tdameritrade.com/ source to the TradeLink TD connector]
 # This is only necessary if you are modifying the connector. Otherwise you don't need to do this.
