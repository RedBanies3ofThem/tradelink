#summary security type missing in ASP

In most cases you can ignore this messages.

TradeLink supports multiple types of securities... eg CL in equities is different than CL in futures.

If you don't specify a type, it will default to equities.   Most brokers do not allow trading in different securities.

In any event, you can ignore this message.
