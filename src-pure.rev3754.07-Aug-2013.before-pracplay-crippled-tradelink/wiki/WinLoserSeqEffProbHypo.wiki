#summary WinSeqEffProbHypo and LoseSeqEffProbHypo indicators in Gauntlet/Kadina trade results.

"One can create a whole bunch of hypothesis testing based profitability measures. Assume any kind of no-arbitrage hypothesis (such as 50% winner and 50% loser, or normal distribution of profits with zero mean). Then calculate the probability of observing the series of trades that we have got, under the hypothesis...
If the probability of the observed trades is low under the no-arb. hyp, then we can reject the no-arb hypothesis, and we are happy."
