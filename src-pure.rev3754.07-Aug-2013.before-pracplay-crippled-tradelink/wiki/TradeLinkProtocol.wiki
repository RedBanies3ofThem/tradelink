#summary Overview of the TradeLink protocol

== Introduction ==
The tradelink protocol is the super-set of all features offered by tradelink.

Through the protocol, you can do things like :
 * register for ticks on a security
 * send orders
 * receive fill notifications
 * get closing imbalance for a stock symbol
 * and more

The [ResponseDocs Response Interface] providers a sub-set of the most common features through a similiar interface.   We recommend you use Responses unless you know what you're doing.

== Mechanics ==

TradeLink messages :
 * are presently sent as Windows Messages.  
 * have a source, destination, type and a message body.
 * have source equal to caption of sending window (often hidden)
 * have destination equal to caption of destination window (often hidden)
 * have message body represented as a serialized string
 * should be deserialized according to message type
 * [http://code.google.com/p/tradelink/source/browse/trunk/TradeLib/TradeLink.cs message types are found in TL2 enums in c#] and [http://code.google.com/p/tradelink/source/browse/trunk/BrokerServers/TradeLibFast/TradeLink.h c++ projects].

You can see the TLClient_WM and TLServer_WM classes in the c++ and c# projects for working examples of this protocol.
