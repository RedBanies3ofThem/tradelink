#summary Easily run tasks in the background

Run Helper allows you to run a time consuming task as a background process.   This is useful for allowing your UI to function while other processes are occuring.



RunHelpers utilize background workers, which are very efficient threads in .net.

For simplicity and avoiding delegates, Run helpers are always called with an empty argument list.   

{{{
using TradeLink.AppKit;

void mybuttonpress(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
   max = (int)numericUpDown1.Value;
   debug("starting computation to "+max);
   RunHelper.run(fib,displayfib,debug,"fibonacci");
   debug("computation to "+max+" running in background");
}

int max = 0;
int prev = 0;
int fib = 1;

void fib()
{
   int c = 0;
   while (c++<max)
   {
      int orgfib = fib;
      fib = prev+fib;
      prev = orgfib;
      // for long running computations or network intensive operations, you may want to periodically rest
      // Util.sleep(20);
   }
}

void displayfib()
{
    debug("computation completed, last fib was: "+fib);
}
