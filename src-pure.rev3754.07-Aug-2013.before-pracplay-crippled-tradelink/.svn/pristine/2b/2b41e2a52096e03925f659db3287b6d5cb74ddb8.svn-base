#summary Tracking Orders

When you send an order to TradeLink, it copies your order back to you.  

You will also receive orders copied from other strategies, and human trading.

You can ignore these, or deal with them as you will.

Example :
{{{
// only allow 10 limit orders per day, cancel other order
int MAX = 10;
int orders = 0;
void GotOrder(Order order)
{
  if (order.isLimit) orders++
  if (orders>MAX)
     SendCancel(order.id);
}

}}}
