#summary ASP/Quotopia disconnects/re-connects/refreshes


ASP and quotopia automatically monitor when ticks stop arriving for a broker.

If ticks have not arrived for a given period of time, these programs will transparently attempt to reconnect.

These messages can happen even if everything is fine, eg :
 # if you are not subscribed to any symbols 
 # if you are subscribed to symbols but they tick infrequently

You can ignore these messages in general.   If you find them annoying :
 * increase the broker reconnection time in asp/quotopia options until it goes away
 * disable connection timeout checking entirely (broker reconnect timeout = 0)
