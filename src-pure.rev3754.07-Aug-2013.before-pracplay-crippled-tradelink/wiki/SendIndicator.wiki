#summary Using indicators

Indicators can be used to examine what your strategy is doing.

You must set the name of each indicator you might be using.

Then whenever you update the Indicator values, you must update them all.

Indicator values must occur in the same sequence as the names when they were created.

{{{
public class MyBox : Response
{
  public MyBox()
  {
    Indicators = new string[] { "Time","Average", "StdDev" };
  }

  // made up function
  StatPack stat = new StatPack();

  void GotTick(Tick tick)
  {
    if (!tick.isTrade) return;  /// only interested in trades
    stat.Update(tick.trade);
    // send statistical values back to user as indicators
    SendIndicators(new object[] { tick.time, stat.Average, stat.StdDev } );
  }
}}}  

Things to be aware of :
  * Gauntlet can write indicator values to a CSV file for importing into Excel or R
  * Kadina displays indicators in the indicators tab
  * Whatever objects you pass to SendIndicators must have a ToString() method.
